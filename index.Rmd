# Introduction to RStudio and Bookdown

JUST MAKING SURE THESE CHANGES GET PROPERLY PUSHED

This is a _tutorial_ book written in **Markdown** via the RStudio package Bookdown. 

## Why RStudio and Bookdown?

As STEM majors we may be able to understand complex concepts but explaining these concepts or ideas to others can be tricky. In order to properly convey these concepts in easy to digest ways we typically lean on different options: LaTeX, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, 

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

You can also perform citations within the text. Such as I wrote a paper this semester about Drought in California for my Violent Weather classes which I wrote within RStudio and Bookdown. Here is an example of a citation directly from the bibliography I created: [@abatzoglou2016]

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
